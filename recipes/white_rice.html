        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>White, uncooked rice of your choice.</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Rice Cooker</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, using a measuring cup, scoop out a cup (or more) of rice into your rice cookers bowl.</li>
            <li>Next, wash the rice under water until the starch washes away. Water will appear murky white at first but will clear up after repeated rice washes.</li>
            <li>After the rice has been washed, fill up the rice bowl according to the rice cookers instructions.</li>
            <li>Place the bowl of rice and water into the rice cooker and press the start button.</li>
            <li>Wait for the rice to cook on its own. Times will vary based on amount/type of rice being cooked.</li>
            <li>After the rice has finished cooking, fluff the rice in the bowl by moving it around gently to prevent the rice from sticking to the walls of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Serve in a bowl or plate, eat, enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
